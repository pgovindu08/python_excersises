#TODO: Define the 'preparation_time_in_minutes()' function below.
# To avoid the use of magic numbers (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)), you should define a PREPARATION_TIME constant.
# You can do that on the line below the 'EXPECTED_BAKE_TIME' constant.
# This will make it easier to do calculations, and make changes to your code.



#TODO: define the 'elapsed_time_in_minutes()' function below.



# TODO: Remember to go back and add docstrings to all your functions
#  (you can copy and then alter the one from bake_time_remaining.)
